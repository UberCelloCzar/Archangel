brb Food. Don't Die, Gust.
AHH Spider! *crashing noises*
I lost the spider. ...So this is how I die.
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but fight this war for me.
*series of weird sneezes*
And I was all "Pewpewpew" and they were all "NGRAHHH". Good times...
Hey, Gust. I uhh... don't think I ever thanked you for doing this.
Ever since we made contact with the Flying City, my dad, y'know, the president, has been acting strange.
I get that his job is stressful in this situation, but he's angrier and he looks at me like he doesn't know me.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say he was an entirely different person. I'm sure the Flying City knows something.
Here they come!
What did that enemy mean by we're "fighting the wrong people"? They attacked us first!... R-right? Hold on.
I'll just hack the security cameras at the bombing site and... Done! *video playing* 
Wait... Those "terrorists" aren't flyers. Those are... my father's secret service?!
Th-that can't be! They must have gone rogue. We need to warn my fa-
GUST, LOOK OUT!
...I've been thinking and... I don't think the Flying Society is who we think they are.
They were obviously framed for the bombing and, despite the war, they have taken care not to kill anyone.
In fact, there have been numerous reports of the enemy saving our soldiers, but they are being covered up.
They almost seem like guardians rather than aggressors. Then... who is our true enemy?
Oh great! People with answers! They don't seem to truly die either so fire away!
I'm sure you've noticed the enemies with colored armor and enhanced abilities by now.
I've tried giving you the same buffs, but the source doesn't come from the suit or the person.
It's... almost like magic.
Magic... You don't think these guys are... WIZARDS?!
They're here! TEACH US YOUR STRANGE ARTS!
In retrospect, wizards wouldn't need wings. They're like... wizards.
Hmm... guardians, wings, magic... Wait, I saw someone praying mid figh-
Nooooooo no no no no no no no no no no no no, they can't be angels.
...........we're all going to Hell for this war, aren't we?
No wonder the enemy numbers don't seem to shrink. They respawn at home immediately! CHEATERS! CHEATER WIZARDS!!!
That confirms it. These guys are angels and their "Flying Society" is actually Heaven.
If that's the case, then why would they fight a war with humanity that they don't intend to finish?
Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way... Why would they save their enemy and tell no one?
I'm going to run a search on the people that were saved and see if I can't find more answers.
AFK. Don't die. That might ruin your weekend plans.
Alright, so my intel tells me that after being saved by "the enemy", soldiers felt less inclined to fight.
Their families also reported... oh my god... "angry and stranger-like dispositions" before the war.
That's just like my dad.
It says here those symptoms cleared up after being saved, but what caused them?
AAARRRGGHH I don't sit at my computer all day to be Ace Detective Skye! *furious rustling*
Demons. Where there's angels, there's demons.
I think demons are somehow influencing humans to fight a war against Heaven.
By possessing humans and having them lead the charge, the demons would incur minimal losses.
Humans can't kill angels though, so they must be looking for an opening to get into Heaven.
I don't want to know what they'll do once they get there, but it can't be good.
Gust, we need to go back to the capital, Daedalus. We have to defeat the demon leaders.
And if my woman's intuition is right, they've possessed the world leaders, including my father.
No matter how you look at this, you'll be attacking world leaders.
I know I've dragged you into enough already, but please, help me with this one last task, for mankind.
Ha! I knew I could count on you! Let's go!
